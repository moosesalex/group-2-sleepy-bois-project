Known Bugs/Issues:

- If a note is within noteTime (currently 2 seconds. found in ScoreManager) of the start of the midi file, it will miss early. Make sure to have at least noteTime seconds of time before your first note.
- If a hold note is longer than noteTime, there will be issues with the hit/miss system since the end note of it hasn't spawned yet.
